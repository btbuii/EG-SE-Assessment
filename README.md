# EG-SE-Assessment
ASSESSMENT Evil Geniuses x Genius League: Software Engineer

Hello,

I've implemented the ProcessGameState script into a Discord Bot that can perform simple filtering functions. 

It's nothing special, but I wanted to take up this project out of curiosity and a challenge for myself, as well as to hopefully provide inspiration to a solution for EG and its coaching staff.

I welcome you to check it out. 
Discord server where I've been hosting and testing the bot (only member is me): https://discord.gg/mchAREvCFS
Github: https://github.com/btbuii/CSGO-Tool

If not, I appreciate you taking the time to read this anyway. Thank you!
